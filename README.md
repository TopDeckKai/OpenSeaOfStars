# THIS MOD IS EARLY IN DEVELOPMENT AND IS NOT READY FOR USE!

# Open Sea of Stars
The idea of this mod for Sea of Stars is to offer an open world save and experience, removing blocking cutscenes / scenes that don't make sense for open world, and working around the codebase to provide a clean base for a Randomizer (Be it standalone or Archipelago). 

## Save File Warning
As this is in development, we need to be cautious with save files. Before installing this mod, PLEASE back up the save files in the AppData\LocalLow\Sabotage Studio\Sea of Stars location on your PC.

## Goals
The goals for this project include:
- Identifying Flags that need to be added to created save files.
- Identifying Cutscene Triggers that need to be deleted or modified for a cleaner experience. (Ex: Mid Level Cutscenes that can be accessed by going through a level backwards, cutscenes that move the player to a different location, etc.).
- Identifying Cutscenes that can be used but need character party modification (Ex: Boss Cutscenes).
- Providing a sample experience that will allow the player to unlock things such as the sea of stars.
